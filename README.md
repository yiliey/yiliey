### Hi there 👋 &nbsp;I'm **Yilei Yuan**

I’m a senior undergraduate studying **Data Science Engineering** at the University of Michigan and **Mechanical Engineering** at Shanghai Jiao Tong University.  
My interests lie in **data-centric machine learning**, **data attribution**, and **multimodal representation learning**.  I aim to develop **reliable, interpretable, and efficient ML systems** that learn robustly from data and generalize across diverse real-world settings.
